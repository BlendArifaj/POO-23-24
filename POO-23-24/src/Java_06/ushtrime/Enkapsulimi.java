Trashegimia:
- Object-oriented programming allows you to define new classes from existing classes. This is called inheritance.
- Inheritance enables you to define a general class (e.g., a superclass) and later extend it to more specialized
    classes (e.g., subclasses).
- Extend
- super
- Overriding | Overloading


Inheritance:
Definition: Inheritance is like passing down traits or abilities from parents to children. In Java, it allows one class
    (the subclass or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods and fields) from another class
    (the superclass or parent class).
Purpose: It helps in reusing code and creating a hierarchy among classes, where common characteristics are shared
    among related classes.
Example: If you have different types of vehicles like cars, bicycles, and motorcycles, they might share common
    characteristics like having wheels, an engine, and the ability to move. You can create a superclass called
    Vehicle with these common traits, and then specific vehicle types (subclasses) like Car, Bicycle, and Motorcycle
    can inherit these traits from the Vehicle class.

Polymorphism:
- Polymorphism means that a variable of a supertype can refer to a subtype object.

Definition: Polymorphism means having many forms. In Java, it allows objects of different classes to be treated
    as objects of a common superclass by using inheritance and method overriding.
Purpose: It allows flexibility in programming by enabling a single method name to represent different behaviors based
    on the actual object type.

2. Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic or Late Binding) - Overriding
